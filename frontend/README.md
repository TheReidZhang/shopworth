Sign up has not implemented cause no database involved.
# 3-4 sentences addressing the feedback you received from TAs and your peers, discuss how the feedback made it into your second prototype. Include quotes and specific feedback to receive credit.
Donghyeon Son: "Better color choices (especially for background color) I might be biased but the contrast between greenish blue and white didn’t seem that pleasant."
I reconstruct my page and now use a dark theme which i believe better. I also change the sign in page(used to be white) to be a modal now so that no need to redirect or change theme.
Daniel Foudeh: "Sprucing up the page a little bit maybe using more bootstrap features."
I use more bootstrap in this benchmark. I use navbar, modal, grid system to make my page organized. Also, I pay attention to various size device. My website can also be accessed in small screen(even though the center search bar can be a problem but I am still figuring it out).
# The name of one API you are planning to use in your final project.
Any shopping website's api including amazon api, ebay api, walmat api.
# 2 (or more) questions you have about your final implementation
1. If I have a user log in, where should I store their information? (I have aws account and currently hosting a rds instance)
2. Those apis seem very hard to access, what if I can't access them in my final implementation.
# What is something you want to learn that will help?
Animation for my website. Trying to do animation that when user click in add to favorite, the item will flying into the cart(just some interactions).
# What is something you’re unsure on how to implement?
Without the access of the apis, it seems very hard to implement. Even with only one api, the comparison does not work b/c it is more than likely that there is only one item selling in that one website. So, all of my work will be based on me having access to api. But I cannot even get twitter api right now. I am bit worried. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
